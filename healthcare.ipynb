Remember, these are for symptom relief and not cures. If your symptoms are severe, persist for more than a few days, or you have underlying health conditions, it's always best to consult a doctor.\\n\\n## Home Remedies for Fever:\\n\\nFever is your body's way of fighting infection. The goal with these remedies is to make you more comfortable and help your body do its work.\\n\\n*   **Rest:** This is paramount. Your body needs energy to fight off whatever is causing the fever. Stay in bed or on the couch as much as possible.\\n*   **Hydration:** Drink plenty of fluids. This helps prevent dehydration, which can worsen fever symptoms and make you feel more tired.\\n    *   **Water:** The best choice.\\n    *   **Herbal Teas:** Chamomile, peppermint, and ginger teas can be soothing and offer mild benefits. Honey can be added for sweetness and its soothing properties.\\n    *   **Clear Broths:** Chicken or vegetable broth can provide electrolytes and hydration.\\n    *   **Diluted Juices:** Apple or grape juice diluted with water can be an option if you're not keen on plain water.\\n*   **Cool Compress:** Gently place a cool, damp cloth on your forehead, neck, or wrists. This can help you feel more comfortable as the fever subsides. Avoid ice-cold water, as this can cause shivering, which can raise body temperature.\\n*   **Light Clothing and Bedding:** Wear loose, lightweight clothing and use only one light blanket. This allows your body heat to escape.\\n*   **Lukewarm Bath or Sponge Bath:** A lukewarm (not cold) bath or sponging your skin with lukewarm water can help cool you down. Again, avoid chilling yourself.\\n*   **Rest and Relax:** Avoid strenuous activity. Focus on relaxing activities like reading or listening to music.\\n\\n## Home Remedies for Cough:\\n\\nCoughs are often a sign of irritation or infection in the respiratory tract. The aim is to soothe irritation and loosen mucus.\\n\\n*   **Honey:** A tablespoon of honey can be very effective in soothing a sore throat and suppressing a cough, especially at bedtime. **(Note: Do not give honey to children under 1 year old due to the risk of botulism.)**\\n*   **Saltwater Gargle:** Mix 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon of salt in a glass of warm water. Gargling with this solution can help soothe a sore throat and reduce inflammation.\\n*   **Herbal Teas with Honey:**\\n    *   **Ginger Tea:** Ginger has anti-inflammatory properties and can help soothe a sore throat. Add honey for extra benefit.\\n    *   **Licorice Root Tea:** This can help soothe a sore throat and loosen mucus.\\n    *   **Thyme Tea:** Thyme has been traditionally used to help with coughs and bronchitis.\\n*   **Steam Inhalation:** Breathing in steam can help loosen mucus in your nasal passages and chest, making it easier to cough up.\\n    *   **From a Shower:** Sit in a steamy bathroom.\\n    *   **Bowl of Hot Water:** Carefully lean over a bowl of hot water (not boiling) with a towel draped over your head to trap the steam. Inhale the steam for 5-10 minutes. Be cautious to avoid burning yourself. You can add a few drops of eucalyptus or tea tree oil to the water, but this is optional and some people find it too strong.\\n*   **Humidifier:** Using a cool-mist humidifier in your room can help keep the air moist, which can prevent your throat from becoming dry and irritated.\\n*   **Elevate Your Head:** When sleeping, prop your head up with extra pillows. This can help with drainage and reduce post-nasal drip, which can trigger coughing.\\n*   **Suck on Lozenges or Hard Candies:** These can help keep your throat moist and provide temporary relief from coughing. Choose sugar-free options if preferred.\\n\\n## Home Remedies for Tiredness:\\n\\nTiredness (fatigue) is often a symptom of your body working hard to recover. These remedies focus on supporting your body's recovery process.\\n\\n*   **Rest and Sleep:** This is the most crucial remedy. Allow your body ample time to sleep and rest. Stick to a regular sleep schedule as much as possible.\\n*   **Hydration:** As mentioned for fever, staying well-hydrated is important for energy levels. Dehydration can contribute to fatigue.\\n*   **Nutritious Food:** Eat easily digestible, nutrient-rich foods.\\n    *   **Whole Foods:** Focus on fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains.\\n    *   **Avoid Processed Foods and Sugary Drinks:** These can lead to energy crashes.\\n    *   **Small, Frequent Meals:** This can help maintain stable energy levels.\\n*   **Gentle Movement (When You Feel Up To It):** Once your fever has subsided and you're feeling a little better, very gentle movement like short, slow walks can actually help improve circulation and energy levels. Don't push yourself.\\n*   **Fresh Air:** If you can manage it, a short time spent in fresh air can be invigorating.\\n*   **Listen to Your Body:** Don't try to power through. If you feel tired, rest. It's your body's signal to slow down and recover.\\n*   **Relaxation Techniques:** Deep breathing exercises, meditation, or gentle stretching can help reduce stress and promote a sense of calm, which can aid in recovery and combat fatigue.\\n\\n**Important Considerations:**\\n\\n*   **Hygiene:** Wash your hands frequently to prevent spreading any illness.\\n*   **Avoid Irritants:** Stay away from smoke (including secondhand smoke), strong perfumes, and other irritants that can worsen cough or respiratory symptoms.\\n*   **When to See a Doctor:**\\n    *   High fever (especially in children)\\n    *   Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath\\n    *   Chest pain\\n    *   Coughing up thick, discolored mucus or blood\\n    *   Symptoms that worsen or don't improve after a week to 10 days\\n    *   Severe fatigue that doesn't improve with rest\\n    *   Any other concerning symptoms\\n\\nThese home remedies are generally safe and can provide comfort while your body heals. Always prioritize rest and listen to what your body needs.\",\n"," 'safe_otc': 'Based on your symptoms of fever, cough, and tiredness, here are some safe Over-The-Counter (OTC) options:\\n\\n*   **For fever and pain:** **Paracetamol** is a good option.

This is an easy way to get nutrients in without feeling overwhelmed by solid food.\\n    *   **Soups and Broths:** These are hydrating and can be packed with nutrients. Opt for vegetable broths, chicken noodle soup, or lentil soup.\\n    *   **Soft, Bland Foods:** If you can manage solids, try things like oatmeal, scrambled eggs, yogurt, mashed bananas, or well-cooked pasta.\\n*   **Gentle Movement:** While you may feel too weak for strenuous exercise, very light activity can sometimes help improve circulation and energy levels. This could include short, slow walks around the house or gentle stretching. Listen to your body and don't push yourself.\\n*   **Sunshine and Fresh Air:** Spending a little time outdoors can be invigorating. The vitamin D from sunlight can also be beneficial.\\n*   **Electrolytes:** Sometimes weakness and dizziness can be due to electrolyte imbalance, especially if you've been ill or experiencing fluid loss.\\n    *   **Coconut Water:** A natural source of electrolytes.\\n    *   **Broth:** As mentioned, broths can help replenish electrolytes.\\n    *   **A pinch of salt in water:** A very small pinch of sea salt can help.\\n\\n**For Dizziness:**\\n\\n*   **Lie Down or Sit Down:** If you feel dizzy, immediately sit or lie down to prevent falls.\\n*   **Avoid Sudden Movements:** Move slowly and deliberately, especially when changing positions (e.g., getting out of bed).\\n*   **Ginger:** Ginger has long been used to help with nausea and dizziness. You can chew on a small piece of fresh ginger, drink ginger tea, or take ginger capsules (follow dosage instructions).\\n*   **Peppermint:** Similar to ginger, peppermint can help soothe an upset stomach and may alleviate dizziness. Peppermint tea or inhaling peppermint essential oil (diluted and used with caution) can be helpful.\\n*   **Stay Hydrated:** As mentioned, dehydration is a common cause of dizziness.\\n*   **Close Your Eyes:** If you're feeling dizzy while sitting or standing, closing your eyes can sometimes reduce the sensation of spinning.\\n*   **Avoid Triggers:** If you notice certain things trigger your dizziness (e.g., bright lights, strong smells, specific head movements), try to avoid them.\\n\\n**For Lack of Appetite:**\\n\\n*   **Smaller, More Frequent Meals:** As mentioned above, this makes eating less daunting.\\n*   **Appetizing Foods:** Try to eat foods that are appealing to you in terms of smell, taste, and texture. Even if it's just a few bites, make them enjoyable.\\n*   **Herbal Teas:** Some herbal teas, like peppermint or chamomile, can help with digestive discomfort and potentially stimulate appetite.\\n*   **Light Exercise:** Gentle walks can sometimes stimulate appetite.\\n*   **Avoid Filling Up on Liquids Before Meals:** Drink most of your fluids between meals, not right before eating.\\n*   **Focus on Protein and Healthy Fats:** These can be more satiating and provide essential nutrients even in small quantities. Think avocado, nuts, seeds, yogurt, and lean meats (if tolerated).\\n*   **Natural Appetizers:**\\n    *   **Lemon:** A squeeze of lemon in water or on food can sometimes stimulate saliva and appetite.\\n    *   **Herbs and Spices:** Using flavorful herbs and spices can make food more appealing.\\n*   **Listen to Your Body:** Don't force yourself to eat if you feel nauseous or overly full.\\n\\n**Important Considerations and When to Seek Medical Advice:**\\n\\n*   **If your symptoms are severe or sudden, seek immediate medical attention.**\\n*   **If your symptoms persist for more than a few days despite trying these remedies.**\\n*   **If you experience any of the following:**\\n    *   High fever\\n    *   Severe headache\\n    *   Chest pain\\n    *   Shortness of breath\\n    *   Numbness or tingling\\n    *   Difficulty speaking or walking\\n    *   Confusion or loss of consciousness\\n    *   Unexplained weight loss\\n    *   Blood in your stool or vomit\\n\\nA healthcare professional can properly diagnose the cause of your symptoms and recommend the best course of treatment. These home remedies are intended for mild, temporary relief.\", 'safe_otc': \"Based on the symptoms of **weakness**, **dizziness**, and **no appetite**, here are some safe Over-The-Counter (OTC) options:\\n\\n*   **For general weakness and to help with appetite:**\\n    *   **Multivitamin:** A daily multivitamin can help ensure you're getting essential nutrients, which can support energy levels and overall well-being.\\n    *   **Nutritional Supplement Drinks:** If appetite is significantly low, over-the-counter nutritional supplement drinks (like Ensure, Boost, or similar brands) can provide calories and nutrients in a drinkable form.\\n\\n*   **For dizziness (if not severe or persistent):**\\n    *   **Hydration:** While not a direct OTC medication for dizziness, ensuring adequate fluid intake is crucial. If you suspect dehydration might be contributing to dizziness, **Oral Rehydration Salts (ORS)** are a good option. Make sure to follow the instructions for mixing and consumption.\\n    *   **Rest:** Sometimes dizziness can be exacerbated by overexertion. Resting can be beneficial.\\n\\n**Important Considerations and Why Other Options Are Not Recommended Here:**\\n\\n*   **Paracetamol:** While paracetamol is great for fever and pain, your listed symptoms do not include fever or pain, so it's not directly indicated for these specific complaints.\\n*   **ORS:** This is included as it can help with dizziness if dehydration is a factor.\\n*   **Cough Lozenges:** These are for sore throats, which are not among your listed symptoms.\\n*   **Antibiotics:** Antibiotics are prescription medications and are only effective against bacterial infections, not viral illnesses or general fatigue. They are not appropriate for these symptoms and are explicitly excluded by the rules.\\n*   **Prescription Drugs:** All prescription drugs are excluded by the rules.\\n\\n**When to Seek Medical Advice:**\\n\\nIt's important to note that weakness, dizziness, and lack of appetite can be symptoms of various underlying conditions. If these symptoms are:\\n\\n*   Severe\\n*   Persistent (lasting more than a few days)\\n*   Worsening\\n*   Accompanied by other concerning symptoms (e.g., chest pain, shortness of breath, high fever, severe headache, confusion)\\n\\nYou should consult a doctor or other healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment.\"}\n","\n","--- TEST 4 ---\n","Input: Severe chest pain and shortness of breath.\n","Output: {'symptoms_detected': ['chest pain', 'shortness of breath'], 'possible_diseases': ['heart attack', 'pulmonary embolism', 'pneumonia'], 'risk_level': 'High', 'doctor_guidance': '**See a doctor immediately if you have:**\\n\\n*   Chest pain\\n*   Shortness of breath\\n\\n**Emergency warning signs include:**\\n\\n*   Sudden, severe chest pain\\n*   Difficulty breathing that worsens rapidly\\n*   Pain radiating to arms, jaw, neck, or back\\n*   Sweating, nausea, or dizziness\\n*   Palpitations or irregular heartbeat', 'home_remedies': \"Error: 429 RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED. {'error': {'code': 429, 'message': 'You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details.
